# fun-examples

Some very simple Gomoku AIs, written by someone naive

Do a little small work like [this](https://github.com/songqun/CPU-verilog)

## Examples

+ c: a startup AI template written in C
+ c_error: only a line different from `c`, but always fails the match!
+ cpp: a startup AI template written in C++
+ cpp_naive: a naive AI written in C++, but stronger than all other examples

## Contributors

The basic example of C is based on [sse2016-gomoku-fun/win-std-client](https://github.com/sse2016-gomoku-fun/win-std-client)

Other examples of C/C++ are written by [tc-imba](https://github.com/tc-imba)
